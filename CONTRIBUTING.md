## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. We expect all contributors to be
respectful, inclusive, and considerate of others.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MorseCodeConverter.git
   cd MorseCodeConverter
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   The project requires Python 3.6 or higher and the pygame library for audio playback.

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Ensure that the application runs correctly:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **main.py**: Entry point for the application, contains the command-line interface.
- **morse_code/**: Package containing all the core functionality.
    - **__init__.py**: Package initialization and exports.
    - **converter.py**: Contains the `MorseCodeConverter` class for text-to-morse and morse-to-text conversion.
    - **morse_code_player.py**: Contains the `MorseCodePlayer` class for audio playback.
    - **morse_code_data.py**: Contains the Morse code dictionary mapping characters to their Morse code representations.
    - **factory.py**: Contains the `MorseCodeConverterFactory` class for creating converter instances.
    - **config.py**: Contains configuration settings for the application.
    - **errors.py**: Contains custom exception classes and error handling utilities.
    - **logging_config.py**: Contains logging configuration and utilities.
    - **ui.py**: Contains user interface functions.
- **docs/**: Directory containing documentation files.
    - **api_documentation.md**: Comprehensive API documentation.
    - **plan.md**: Improvement plan for the project.
    - **tasks.md**: Task list for project improvements.
    - **user_guide.md**: User guide with detailed instructions and examples.
- **logs/**: Directory containing log files generated by the application.

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use a simplified Git workflow:

1. **main**: The main branch contains the stable version of the code.
2. **feature branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.

When starting work on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Coding Standards

We follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code. Please ensure your code
adheres to these standards.

Key points to remember:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs).
- Maximum line length is 100 characters.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Include docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.
- Add type hints to function signatures.
- Add appropriate error handling.

### Testing

We use Python's built-in `unittest` framework for testing. When adding new features or fixing bugs, please include
appropriate tests.

To run the tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

When writing tests:

- Test both normal operation and edge cases.
- Ensure that error conditions are properly tested.
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate.
- Keep tests independent of each other.

### Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for the project. When making changes:

- Update docstrings for any modified code.
- Update the API documentation if you change the public API.
- Update the user guide if you change user-facing functionality.
- Add inline comments for complex code sections.

## Submitting Contributions

### Creating Issues

Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, check if there's already an issue for it. If not, create a new issue
describing:

- What you want to accomplish
- Why it's valuable
- Any implementation details you've considered

### Pull Requests

When you're ready to submit your changes:

1. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch.

3. In the pull request description:
    - Reference the issue it addresses (e.g., "Fixes #123")
    - Describe the changes you've made
    - Mention any testing you've done
    - Note any documentation you've updated

### Code Review Process

All pull requests will be reviewed by the project maintainers. The review process ensures:

1. Code quality and adherence to coding standards
2. Appropriate test coverage
3. Proper documentation
4. Alignment with the project's goals

Reviewers may request changes before merging. Please be responsive to feedback and make the requested changes.

## Release Process

The project follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for new functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes

Releases are created by the project maintainers and documented in the CHANGELOG.md file.

## Community

We welcome contributions from everyone. If you have questions or need help, you can:

- Create an issue on GitHub
