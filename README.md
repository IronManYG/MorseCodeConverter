# International Morse Code Converter and Player

## Project Overview
The International Morse Code Converter and Player is a Python-based application that allows users to convert text to Morse code and vice versa, and to play Morse code sounds. This project combines data processing and audio manipulation to create an interactive tool for both Morse code enthusiasts and learners.

## Features
- **Text to Morse Code Conversion**: Convert any text into its Morse code representation.
- **Morse Code to Text Conversion**: Translate Morse code back into readable text.
- **Morse Code Sound Playback**: Play the sound of the Morse code for any given text or Morse code input.
- **Interactive Console Menu**: Easy-to-navigate options for all functionalities.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install `pygame` for sound playback. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage
- **Starting the Application**: Run `main.py` to start the application.
- **Navigating the Menu**: Use the menu to choose between converting text to Morse code, converting Morse code to text, playing Morse code sound, or exiting the application.
- **Conversion and Playback**: Follow the prompts to input text or Morse code and choose whether to play the Morse code sound.

## Modules
- **Converter (`converter.py`)**: Handles the conversion between text and Morse code.
- **Morse Code Player (`morse_code_player.py`)**: Manages the audio playback of Morse code.
- **Morse Code Data (`morse_code_data.py`)**: Contains the mapping of text to Morse code.
