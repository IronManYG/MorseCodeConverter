[x] Add type hints to all functions and methods
[x] Implement proper exception classes for the application

## 2. Error Handling and Validation

[x] Add input validation for all user inputs in main.py
[x] Improve error handling in the MorseCodeConverter class
[x] Add proper error handling for pygame initialization in MorseCodePlayer
[x] Implement validation for Morse code input in from_morse_code method
[x] Add error handling for file operations (if added in future)
[x] Implement graceful exit handling
[x] Add validation for configuration parameters
[x] Create comprehensive error messages for users

## 3. Documentation and Comments

[x] Add docstrings to all classes and methods
[x] Create a comprehensive API documentation
[x] Add inline comments for complex code sections
[x] Update README.md with more detailed usage examples
[x] Create a user guide with examples
[x] Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors
