# Morse Code Converter Test Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the Morse Code Converter project. It defines the testing
strategy, test cases, and test procedures to ensure the reliability, functionality, and performance of the application.

## Test Strategy

### Testing Levels

The Morse Code Converter project employs a multi-level testing approach:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation
    - MorseCodeConverter class
    - MorseCodePlayer class
    - Error handling modules
    - Factory pattern implementation

2. **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between components
    - Converter and Player interaction
    - Factory and Converter interaction
    - Error handling across components

3. **Performance Testing**: Measuring and benchmarking performance
    - Text-to-Morse conversion performance
    - Morse-to-text conversion performance
    - Audio generation performance

### Testing Approach

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before implementing features
- **Mocking**: Using mocks for external dependencies (e.g., pygame for audio)
- **Parameterized Testing**: Testing with multiple inputs and expected outputs
- **Edge Case Testing**: Testing boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Testing Tools

- **unittest**: Python's built-in testing framework
- **unittest.mock**: For creating mock objects and patching functions
- **coverage**: For measuring test coverage
- **benchmark.py**: Custom benchmarking tool for performance testing

## Test Cases

coverage run -m unittest discover
coverage report
coverage html
```

## Test Environment

### Hardware Requirements

- Any computer capable of running Python 3.6 or higher
- Audio output device (for manual testing of audio playback)

### Software Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pygame library
- coverage library (for test coverage)

## Test Data

Test data is defined in the `test_fixtures.py` file, including:

- Text-to-Morse conversion samples
- Morse-to-text conversion samples
- Additional Morse code samples
- Custom Morse code dictionary for testing variant registration

## Test Reporting

Test results should be reported in the following format:

- Number of tests run
- Number of tests passed
- Number of tests failed
- Details of any failures
- Test coverage percentage

## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, which automatically runs all tests on each push to the
repository. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/python-tests.yml`.

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Identify the component or feature to be tested
2. Create a new test method in the appropriate test file
3. Follow the unittest pattern:
    - Define test methods that start with `test_`
    - Use assertion methods like `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, etc.
4. Run the tests to ensure they pass

### Updating Existing Tests

1. Identify the test that needs to be updated
2. Modify the test to reflect changes in requirements or implementation
3. Run the tests to ensure they pass

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the Morse Code Converter project. By following this plan, we
can ensure that the application is reliable, functional, and performs well.
